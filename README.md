# NLP on Financial Statement 


In this project, I did a  NLP Analysis on 10-k financial statements to generate an alpha factor. For the dataset, I used the end of day from Quotemedia and Loughran-McDonald sentiment word lists.

# Sentiment Analysis using Nueral Networks 

In this project, I built my own own deep learning model to classify the sentiment of messages from StockTwits, a social network for investors and traders. The model predicts if any particular message is positive or negative. From this, I was able to generate a signal of the public sentiment for various ticker symbols.

# Combining Signals for enhanced Alpha 
In this project, I combined signals on a random forest for enhanced alpha. While implementing this, I solved the problem of overlapping samples. For the dataset, I used the end of day from Quotemedia and sector data from Sharadar.

# Building a Backtester 
In this project, I  built a fairly realistic backtester that uses the Barra data. The backtester will perform portfolio optimization that includes transaction costs, and I  implement it with computational efficiency in mind, to allow for a reasonably fast backtest. I used performance attribution to identify the major drivers of your portfolio's profit-and-loss (PnL).
